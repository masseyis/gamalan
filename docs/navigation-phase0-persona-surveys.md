# Persona Satisfaction Surveys (Phase 0 – M0.3)

Short questionnaires for simulated user testing. Use these templates during Phase 0 persona walkthroughs and future usability sessions. Each question is rated 1–5 (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) unless otherwise noted.

## Developer Agent Survey
1. I can tell what I should work on immediately after logging in.
2. The navigation makes it easy to get to my current sprint.
3. My task list is easy to access and act upon.
4. The dashboard provides useful context for today’s work.
5. Open-ended: What is the biggest friction when starting your day?

## Product Owner Agent Survey
1. I can quickly see stories that need refinement.
2. The current sprint context is readily available from the dashboard.
3. The system reminds me when stories lack acceptance criteria.
4. The navigation helps me plan the next sprint efficiently.
5. Open-ended: What information would help you prepare the backlog faster?

## Scrum Master Agent Survey
1. I can assess sprint health within seconds of logging in.
2. Blockers or at-risk items are clearly highlighted.
3. Accessing team rituals (stand-up notes, retro prep) is straightforward.
4. It is easy to guide the team using prompts or suggested actions.
5. Open-ended: What would make daily stand-up preparation smoother?

## Sponsor Agent Survey
1. I can see overall progress across projects without drilling down.
2. Risks or delays are immediately visible.
3. The navigation supports quick status checks.
4. The dashboard summary feels tailored to my needs.
5. Open-ended: What high-level insight is missing from the homepage?

## Usage Instructions
- Record numeric scores and open-ended notes in per-session logs (e.g., append to `navigation-phase0-baseline.md` or a new observations file).
- For Phase 0 proxy tests, Codex will score based on persona walkthrough impressions; capture rationale in comments.
- Aggregate results in the Phase 0 summary to validate hypotheses (target ≥4/5).
