# Navigation Focus Personas (Phase 0)

Working team: James (product/engineering) + Codex (delivery).  
These personas act as proxy “agents” to frame Phase 0 research and decision making.

| Persona Agent | Primary Goals | Key Pain Points Today | Phase 0 Questions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Developer Agent (“Dev”)** | See current sprint context instantly; know the next task; avoid digging through navigation. | Needs to jump between tasks/board/backlog; current dashboard lacks actionable list; difficult to tell priority when backlog is large. | How quickly can Dev move from login → start work? Which story/task metadata should be surfaced first? What completion states trigger “what’s next” nudges? |
| **Product Owner Agent (“PO”)** | Maintain sprint/backlog health; ensure stories ready with ACs; track team commitments. | Grooming signals buried; no proactive reminders about large/unstable stories; navigation to sprint context indirect. | Which readiness signals matter most (story size, ACs, readiness overrides)? How should we prioritise prompts vs. metrics on dashboard? |
| **Scrum Master Agent (“SM”)** | Monitor sprint execution, blockers, and ceremonies; keep team flow steady. | Active sprint hidden in Teams area; limited visibility into blockers/commitments; lacks quick links to stand-up artifacts. | What KPIs (capacity, blocker count) must be front and centre? Which sources identify blockers automatically? |
| **Sponsor Agent (“Sponsor”)** | High-level view across projects/teams; confirm progress versus goals. | Must browse multiple projects; navigation bias towards individual workflows; limited aggregated reporting on dashboard. | Do we need a cross-team summary card? How do we surface risk without overwhelming other personas? |

## Usage in Phase 0
- Use these agents when drafting interview scripts, evaluating telemetry, or ideating tasks.  
- Capture findings against the “Phase 0 Questions” column inside forthcoming research notes.  
- Update personas as we learn more about real user behaviour.
