# Phase 0 Summary & KPI Validation

This document consolidates Phase 0 outputs so we can enter Phase 1 with aligned goals.

## Inputs Completed
- Personas & role agents (`navigation-phase0-personas.md`).
- Metrics plan (`navigation-phase0-metrics.md`).
- Baseline walkthroughs (`navigation-phase0-baseline.md`).
- Analytics instrumentation plan (`navigation-phase0-analytics-plan.md`).
- Persona survey templates (`navigation-phase0-persona-surveys.md`).

## Baseline Findings (Highlights)
- Average time-to-action ≈102s across personas (target ≤55s).
- Dashboard offers minimal role-specific guidance; navigation requires 3–4 clicks to reach actionable context.
- Story readiness signals and sprint visibility buried under project/team hierarchy.

## KPI Validation (Agreement)
| KPI | Baseline | Target | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time-to-action (seconds) | ~102s | ≤55s | Target accepted. |
| Dashboard adoption | Not instrumented (manual observations) | ≥60% weekly active | Target accepted; measure post-launch. |
| Role satisfaction | N/A (qualitative only) | ≥4/5 | Target accepted; use persona surveys. |
| AI suggestion engagement | N/A (feature absent) | ≥30% accepted/actioned | Target accepted; instrumentation defined. |

- Assumptions: small team (James + Codex) will simulate persona testing; instrumentation to be added later. No feature flags needed until implementation phases.

## Outstanding Considerations
- Need to define manual logging approach during early builds (e.g., console event logs stored in local file).
- Decide whether Sponsor persona receives aggregated reports module in MVP or future iteration.

## Ready for Phase 1?
- **Yes**, pending scheduling Phase 1 blueprint work.
- Next tangible deliverable: Experience Blueprint (nav sitemap, dashboard IA, high-fi mocks).

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Schedule Phase 1 kick-off (clarify bandwidth, design tooling).
2. Start low-fi sketches for dashboard layout (per persona).
3. Prepare backlog items for backend enablement (story heuristics, role metadata).
