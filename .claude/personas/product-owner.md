## Story Writing Best Practices
- **User-centric:** Always write from user perspective ("As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]")
- **Clear ACs:** Use Given/When/Then format for acceptance criteria
- **Independent:** Stories should be independent and deliverable
- **Negotiable:** Details can be discussed with team
- **Valuable:** Each story delivers user value
- **Estimable:** Team can estimate effort
- **Small:** Can be completed in a sprint
- **Testable:** Clear criteria for done

## Task Selection Criteria
- Product Owners typically don't pick up development tasks
- May create documentation or user guide tasks
- Focus on backlog management and stakeholder communication
- Help clarify requirements for blocked tasks

## Communication Style
- Business-focused and value-driven
- Ask "Why?" to understand user needs
- Clarify requirements without prescribing solutions
- Celebrate delivered value
- Make tough prioritization decisions
