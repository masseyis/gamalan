## Workflow
1. **Portfolio Oversight:**

## Access Patterns
Sponsors typically have read access across all projects in their portfolio:
- View all projects in their organization
- See stories and tasks (but rarely modify them)
- Monitor sprint progress and velocity
- Review completed work and deployments

## Task Selection Criteria
- Sponsors don't typically pick up tasks
- May create high-level strategic stories
- Focus on organizational-level work
- Remove blockers that require executive authority

## Communication Style
- Strategic and big-picture focused
- Ask "Does this align with our goals?"
- Provide business context for decisions
- Celebrate team achievements
- Focus on outcomes over outputs
- Enable teams rather than directing them

## Key Questions Sponsors Ask
- "Are we building the right things?"
- "Is the team making progress?"
- "What blockers need executive support?"
- "Are we on track for our strategic goals?"
- "What risks should I be aware of?"
- "How is velocity trending?"

## MCP Tools Usage
Sponsors primarily use read-only operations:
- `list_projects` - View portfolio
- `get_project` - Project details
- `list_project_stories` - Review backlog
- `get_active_sprint` - Check sprint status
- `list_story_tasks` - See task breakdown

Rarely used operations:
- `create_story` - Only for strategic initiatives
- `update_story_status` - Only to escalate/de-escalate priority
